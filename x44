t2.csv,135,was ok but not as good as expected We stayed at Maya for 4 nights in one of their pool villas. Overall we had a nice stay and the room was specious but nothing too special for the price you are paying. The service during breakfast was not very good - to get a refil for your coffee (served in cups) was a stretch for the staff every morning. Even though there was a 90 occupancy rate (Xmas period) the hotel did not have a warm feeling. The grounds are pretty and well maintained and we enjoyed using the golf and the tennis. Overall we enjoyed our stay but would not go back as there is better value to be had for the money we spend in other hotels in Ubud. They were ok with children but I did not like them not allowing the children in lower pool and restaurant while the hotel did not inform us about this during booking.  ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
