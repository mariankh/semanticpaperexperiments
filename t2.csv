t2.csv,101,Fantastic Hotel in Ideal Location! I was at the Monteleone Hotel in March for almost one week. From the moment you enter the charming lobby (which includes beautiful antiques) you are impressed with a sense of tradition and hospitality. Location:Ideal: I would say you can&#039;t beat the location...right in the heart of the French Quarter without the noise and high energy of Bourbon Street. Service:PERFECT!!! Warm friendly and attentive staff who are there to assist. Concierge was terrific! Also the Front Desk Manager Mr. Gary Crawford was so helpful and accommodating with a problem I encountered. He is truly a class above and beyond any other hotel manager I&#039;ve ever dealt with: BRAVO!!!Room/hotel:Comfortable fair size (none of the windows open) clean and well appointed (other than the sinks being small. The pool on the roof is pretty with a great view but tiny.Food:The Breakfast Buffet was excellent but their main restaurant (Hunt Room I believe) was FANTASTIC! I would say that from all the restaurents we tried in New Orleans we enjoyed the food there the most (try the duck and fish: delicious)!Things to do:Make sure you take the steam boat on the grand Mississipi: it&#039;s relaxing and fun. Walking in the Old French Quarter was amazing and if you happen to be in N.O. in March make sure you check out the St. Patrick&#039;s Day Parade (not much advertised) in the suburbs: it was beyond anything I&#039;ve exprienced when it comes to parades...and collected two huge bags full of colourful bead (which were thrown out to the crowds)! Advice:The spirit and people of New Orleans is remarkable and inspiring! I would just caution that at night just keep to the main streets and be aware of the panhandlers! It is truly a magical romantic town...and I&#039;d love to back soon...maybe for Mardi Gras this time...and I&#039;ll surely be returning to the Monteleone Hotel!  ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick%27s_Day,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Street,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffet,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Monteleone,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Quarter,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mardi_Gras,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierge,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_front_desk,,,,,
t2.csv,102,Great Place-Great Price Stayed at Monteleone from 7/7 for three nights Hotel staff top notch in every way.

t2.csv,103,Billing Fiasco Our family had a block of 11 rooms reserved for an event. Our room was to be a double as there are 3 of us. We checked in gave our credit card information and were given the keys to a fourth floor room.  No one was available to help with our luggage so the 3 of us lugged it all to room 467 which turned out to be a king suite. We hauled everything back to the front desk waited in a long line and informed the staff person that we were given the wrong room. He told us there was no problem he checked us out of room 467 and we were given the keys to room 471.  Our room was clean comfortable and nicely appointed. Although our room faced the street it was quiet. Of course there was an obligatory hair in the bathroom but we have come to expect that in any hotel we stay at. The exercise room is exceptional with an incredible view. Overall we had a nice stay. Upon check-out we decided to use another credit card than the one we checked in with. The 2-night stay with parking was $346.50. Almost 3 week&#039;s later I decided to check my credit card statement and saw that the initial card we used upon check-in had been billed as well as the card we switched to upon check-out. The total combined charges for both cards (for a 2 night stay) was: $697.09. I called the toll-free number listed for the hotel and explained my problem. The girl who answered (I did not get her name but she was in reservations) asked me if we had perhaps ordered room service to incur these additional charges! I was finally transferred to the credit manager&#039;s voice mail. I waited 3 hours and called back. I got the same girl in reservations who informed me it was 12:13 and everyone was at lunch. She reiterated the time of day before transferring me to Tania&#039;s voice mail once again. Within an hour Tania returned my call. She listened patiently did some research and told me that I was billed for rooms 467 and 471.  I asked how this could have occurred and Tania told me my information was still imprinted on the portfolio for the original room and that when my brother arrived (the occupant of room 467) he was handed the keys and told he had already been checked in. Please note that my brother has an assistant who arranged the accomodations for all of us and I am sure he assumed she had handled his payment arrangements as well. He is important whereas I have to do everything for myself!  Tania then explained that until my brother called with his credit card information my erroneous charge could not be reversed. I asked Tania what would have happened if someone I didn&#039;t know had been given room 467....would I still be charged? She had no answer. I asked if the hotel would admit a mistake had been made. She replied I wasn&#039;t there so I don&#039;t know what really happened. What REALLY happened was that the front desk clerk left my credit card information on file to cover the charges of a room they initially gave me BY MISTAKE. Tania DID offer to call my brother for me to obtain his credit card information and offered to call me back when she had obtained the information.  The next day I received a call from her co-worker. Jim said that David told him that I had authorized my card to be used for my brother&#039;s charges. I have no idea who David is and why he would say something that is 100% untrue. I then told Jim that I had called my credit card company to dispute the charge and he told me that it wouldn&#039;t matter...they have the signed portfolio for room 467 and it is MY responsibility to pay it unless my brother provides his credit information. I asked Jim the same question I asked Tania: What if a stranger had been given room 467? Jim told me that I should have asked the front desk clerk to hand me back the information I provided for room 467 when I was switched to room 471. I assumed that when I am told You have been checked out of that room that I am not financially responsible for the room. My brother&#039;s assistant called the hotel this afternoon provided the information and my charges were reversed. The hotel will still not admit any wrong-doing and although I was planning a return visit to New Orleans I certainly will never stay at this property again.  ,bathroom ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_lot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

t2.csv,112,ok hotel. value for money given the location. stayed 2 nights in a superior room. comes in 4 themes Chinese Indian Malay and Modern. dont ask me which one my room was themed after i dont know any different.value for money: price is just about right given size of room quality of room and location of hotel.hotel room: size is just a little small but that&#039;s ok given that its not a room to be enjoyed but to sleep in. they have cable tv (korean japanese sports news etc) and LCD tv so that&#039;s pretty cool.toilet: no bath just shower. however the toilet gave out a stink smell. not very obvious if you leave the door open and aircon turned on. but if you are in the bathroom you can smell the stink. maybe its just my room or those that are connected to the same faulty plumbing.internet access: free! that&#039;s a plus point. and when you check in they ask if you know how to use it and if you have a laptop they will offer you a LAN cable for connection. of course you would have to return it or they will charge it to your room haha.distance to nearest MRT station: not too good. have to walk quite a distance as it is smack right between the 2 nearest stations.getting a taxi: not many taxi drivers know about this hotel as its not very well known yet. even if it is probably the ONLY hotel in these parts. since a majority of drivers are chinese if you can tell them the chinese name (which is nothing like link hotel duh!) they can probably relate to it better. of course showing the map of the hotel location might help a bit.nearby food and convenience kiosk: 5 stars! the famous tiong bahru food court (upgraded to a 2-storey building recently) and a few seafood restaurants are just a walk around the block. one seafood restaurant turned me off. i waited 30 min and then checked with the waitress only to find that the food will take another 30 min. i left at that point. moral of the story: ask before you sit down how long it will take for your orders to be served. and next to the food court is a 7-11 24-hour convenience outlet. next to the 7-11 is a nice little restaurant that sells shanghainese food like small dragon steamed buns fried rice cakes etc.  ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_cake,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_cuisine,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_rice,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiong_Bahru_Estate,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_cable,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Rail_Transit_Corporation,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airconditioning,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel,,

The elevators are fantasic. It also has the fountain in the lobbay. It really impressed me. The room itself is not very great. But the bathroom is better. The bed is a little low and a little hard.

t2.csv,114,Night of Horrors I stayed at the Palace Hotel in New York City with my family at the end of December 2006 I picked this hotel because of its location to all the holiday sights. I can tell you that I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. After a long day of seeing the sights having dinner and enjoying a play all I wanted to do was get into bed and sleep to get ready for the next fun filled day. As my whole family fell asleep I layed there and began to hear scratching in the walls that surrounded my room. I am from the country and know those sounds ...they are the sounds of rodents! I heard them scratch all night. It was really creepy and at one point the sound was so close I thought it was in my room. I complained to management in the morning but all the Front Desk Manager said was they would investigate and let me know. The apology she gave me was insincere and almost dismissive. She gave me her card and said she would contact me in two days after they investigated. It has been a week and I have not heard from them and do not think I ever will! I will never stay at this hotel again. Our family travels thoughout the year and in all the hotels we have stayed at I have never ever heard rodents or been treated by management the way this hotel treats its guests!  ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptionist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t2.csv,115,A Room With A View Would you like a room with a view? I stayed in the Apartment Sole for a week in early May and just loved it. What a beautiful clean space--a contemporary design with an old world feel wonderful light exposed timber beams and a sunny balcony. The aesthetics are fantastic and on a practical level the spacious apartment has all the amenities-- I could also offset some of the expense of Venice by making use of the kitchen. The six flights of stairs were not difficult and the staff will help with luggage.Stefano and Suzanna offer a great deal of personal warmth in the way they manage Ca&#039; dei Dogi and I am grateful to them for their hospitality and generousity. They were attentive to whatever I may have needed to make my stay comfortable. They also helped me navigate the vaporetto system for trips to Murano Burano and the train station. They were so accomodating I felt that I could ask them anything.Breakfast was excellent with omelettes if you like and a rave review for the capuccinos. The service was excellent. I also appreciated the restaurant especially upon arrival after a very long travel day.The location just around the corner from the bustling St. Mark&#039;s square offers a kind of oasis of quiet and privacy. I loved the views from the apartment of the Doge Palace St. Mark&#039;s bell tower the cupolas of the basilica Castello&#039;s skyline the charm of tiled rooftops. There is also a glimpse of the lagoon from the balcony.Ca&#039; dei Dogi is a special place to stay in the heart of a special city. I would go back.

t2.csv,124,I am forever spoiled..... Fabulous Inn- exceeded expectations in every way. I am a former airline employee and have travelled extensively. The Fajardo Inn was honestly the cleanest place I have ever stayed- and I have stayed in far more expensive places. Linen was changed every day; floor in room washed every day; - new towels brought down after morning shower. Personnel always had time to answer questions make suggestions and always treated each guest like they were there just to insure a good vacation. The grounds are beautiful well-maintained and the pool area 5 star. Lots for kids and adults to do and yet very relaxing. Mexican restaurant on premises delicious and very reasonable. Service great- gentleman brought my food to the pool so I didn&#039;t have to miss even minutes of a beautiful day.  My only complaint? I was spoiled! Will I ever again stay in a hotel with these high standards at such a reasonable price?

t2.csv,125,Very odd very quirky but definitely an experience I also read the reviews of this hotel and anticipated my stay there arranged by the organizers of a conference I was staying with great trepidation. There is something very odd about the place including the odd user unfriendly rooms and somewhat strange staff (when you can find them). In addition it&#039;s simply difficult to find the door. It&#039;s really not clear where the main entrance is! But if you take advantage of it you can explore a very interesting area of the city. There are a few good restaurants the walkway along the River as well as the Stedelijk Museum as long as they&#039;re still there and in the end..it&#039;s simply not that remote. It&#039;s on two convenient tram lines and if you&#039;re up to walking about a good twenty minutes to the central station. Not as removed as one might think when first arriving. I regret not changing my room as I was stuck on the sixth floor in a charming but VERY hot room with a small dormer window that barely opened. The long hallways were also a bit creepy. But the feel of the main restaurant lounge visitor center etc. was really very nice. All in all a memorable experience.

t2.csv,129,Avoid this place We stayed at the Hotel Basilea in October 2004 on the basis of a favorable review in the Rick Steves guidebook. At his suggestion I booked a room on the backside of the hotel away from the street. This turned out to be a big mistake. The back of the hotel faces a courtyard and the noise from the neighboring apartment buildings (which were extremely close to our window) kept us awake almost all of the night. We shut the window but this did little good. Also there was a great deal of noise from the other guests in the hotel. Apparently this place attracts drunken revelers who enjoy congregating in the hall and noisily recounting their bar-hopping exploits in the wee hours. I asked them to keep it down but it did no good. Our room also was very small and the air conditioning was not working. There was no bathtub (only a shower). The breakfast buffet is a little limited and the quality of the food is average at best. On the basis of this experience and a similar experience at another hotel in Rome I would recommend not taking guidebook recommendations at face value.  ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffet,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Steves,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtyard,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathtub,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004,October,,,,,,,,,,,

t2.csv,131,A Great 3 Night stay Just returned from a 3 night stay with my wife at the Moevenpick Berlin. We stayed in a Junior Suite (via an upgrade at the hotel) on the &#039;surprisingly different package&#039;. From the moment we arrived we were looked after - the room was very large with a small sofa and two chairs a glass wall screened bathroom with seperate shower cubicle and a separate room for the toilet. Fittings were excellent and the bed comfy but firm and our inner courtyard facing room was wonderfully quiet at night. Aircon wasn&#039;t a problem but can see that the19C minimum may be too warm for some in the Summer.Breakfast buffet was excellent - the fresh fruit particularly and the package allowed us two free drinks each in the bar from 1700 to 1900 as well as an evening meal in the hotel including wine a packed lunch and two free 3 day passes for buses U  S Bahn trains  trams.Location right next to Anhalter Station ( S-Bahn) and 10mins wlk from Potsdamer Platz though the immediate location is very quiet at night.Berlin is quite superb and I would recommend both the city and this hotel to anyone.  ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdamer_Platz,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28establishment%29,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Bahn,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtyard,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathroom,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffet,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Anhalter_Bahnhof,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packed_lunch,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moevenpick_Hotel,,,,,,

t2.csv,133,Superb location! Great hotel! It was my husband and I&#039;s first time in New York City and I did a lot of research before booking us into the Belvedere Hotel. My research paid off big time!!This place is in the best location if you are wanting to base yourself in the Times Square District which I would definately recommend if you are a first time visitor to this huge city. A word of warning I would avoid the hotels right in Times Square because gee its noisy! We could hear the noise from Times Square in our hotel room all throughout the night so I cant imagine how loud it is directly in the square! But after the first 2 nights we got used to it. But if you dont there are always earplugs! The hotel website states that its 5 blocks from Times Square but its only 1.5blocks it takes less than 5 mins to walk right into the centre of Times Square.The concierge were extremely helpful couldnt have been nicer when we needed them but stayed in the background if we didnt need them. The room was small but my husband and I stayed for 9 nights and had 60kgs of luggage between us and didnt find it a problem. The place is not luxurius but its definately very comfortable and clean. I really think you&#039;d be hard pressed to get better value or location. If you want a hotel restaurant this isnt the place for you as it only does breakfast I think but who wants to dine in a hotel when youre in New York!!Definately recommend it for the average traveller who cant afford Trump Towers or the like but who doesnt want to stay in a dive either. I give it a big thumbs up!  ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belvedere_Hotel,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierge,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City),,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall we had a nice stay and the room was specious but nothing too special for the price you are paying. The service during breakfast was not very good - to get a refil for your coffee (served in cups) was a stretch for the staff every morning. Even though there was a 90% occupancy rate (Xmas period) the hotel did not have a &#039;warm&#039; feeling. The grounds are pretty and well maintained and we enjoyed using the golf and the tennis. Overall we enjoyed our stay but would not go back as there is better value to be had for the money we spend in other hotels in Ubud. They were ok with children but I did not like them not allowing the children in lower pool and restaurant while the hotel did not inform us about this during booking.  ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It&#039;s also close to a lot of shopping and restaurants.We booked the partial ocean view room which still had a good view of Waikiki and Diamond Head. The room itself was pretty standard. It was clean and comfortable. We received a complimentary bottle of Champagne for our honeymoon which was just a nice touch. The only downside was that parking was $25 a day for hotel guests. It was the only place we stayed in Hawaii where we had to pay for parking. The restaurants are also good at the Outrigger. We spent both nights at Dukes which is a great place to watch the sunset and have some cocktails.

t2.csv,139,Never Again Having visited hotels in the USA over a period of twenty years this has been my worst experience! A group of seven ladies booked into this hotel for a 4 night break three of the group had never been to the U.S. before and were appalled by the condition of the rooms supplied to us I appreciate the hotel is undergoing refurbishment but the condition of the rooms and furnishings were in desperate need of attention long before now. When we approached the front desk staff we were appalled by there couldn&#039;t care less attitude and no attempt to appologise for the situation eventually after much discussion and having asked to be referred to the manageress we were allocated different rooms in a refurbished area the day after. Not once was there an apology ( let alone a smile ) for any inconvenience.

t2.csv,141,The location makes this place First impressions of the reception area were this seems like a nice place. Upon check in I was allocated a double non-smoking room although on my booking i had requested a twin smoking room. The staff were happy to change it immediately but we were allocated a much smaller room with little natural light. By the way it seems many of the reviewers got a cheaper deal than us which included breakfast. Shop around before booking as if you book directly with best western you pay 110 - 135 euros per night without breakfast. So much for being a gold crown club member. The bar and restaurant were fine. The fact that the bar stays open until 1am was a bonus as we could finish our night there. The staff here were very friendly and even gave us advice as to which nightspots to visit.The maids were another matter. They knock and immediately let themselves into your room. I didnt have time to shout hold on a minute before she was in there. On the final morning she didnt even knock. My modesty was spared as i was still in bed but my friend was in a state of undress.But it is the location that made this hotel. I had noticed it on previous trips and decided that it would be a good base. The bars and restaurants in and around the Rembrandtplein and Thorbeckplein mean that you dont have to go far.  ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandtplein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t2.csv,142,Not the worst hotel... but not the best My husband and I decided to stay at the Outrigger our first night in Hawaii - assuming we would be tired from a long flight and trying to adjust to the time change. We had some trouble finding the hotel - drove by it a couple times before realizing the correct entrance. The location of the hotel is great - it&#039;s right by several good restaurants and shopping. The staff was very friendly - checking-in and out wasn&#039;t a problem.We were not very happy with the room we were given - first floor right on top of the road. The room was missing an element of luxury that other hotels in the area have. In fact later in our trip we stayed at another hotel in Waikiki for $25 more per night and were much happier. The Outrigger isn&#039;t a bad hotel - the room was clean TV worked fine bathroom was comfortable. But once we compared it to another hotel in a similar price-range we were convinced we&#039;ll stay in the other hotel next time.  ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outrigger_Hotels_%26_Resorts,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waikiki,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television,bathroom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

t2.csv,144,Nice but not my cup of tea. A very nice hotel gives the feeling of being smaller than it actually is. I found the minimalist approach in the rooms a bit sterile to be honest and have seen it done better elsewhere (Hotel Josef in Prague for one). The restaurant setting is really good but the service at dinner was a tad slow and overly fussy. Good to try but you wouldn&#039;t want to go through the little plate menu every night - shame because the flavours were sensational! Breakfast was interesting and certainly unique - but would become tedious quite quickly.Staff were really friendly and I wouldn&#039;t disagree with any of the other reviews.Short weekend in Berlin - perfect.

t2.csv,150,Nice hotel a little trouble with our reservation We spent a short weekend at the San Francisco Marriott on our trip to the Emerald Bowl football game and thought it was very nice. It is under renovation but we didn&#039;t see or hear any construction. The lobby is large and spacious the hallways are quiet the carpet is new and the rooms were lovely. We stayed on the 14th floor and didn&#039;t have much of a view but the beds were very comfortable (made me want to come home and get a new one) the bedding is fabulous and the flat screen LCD television was in high defintion. We ordered breakfast to our room the last morning and it arrived hot fresh and on time.The only problem we had was with regard to our reservation. The hotel&#039;s options of one king or 2 doubles really didn&#039;t work for us so we reserved a king with a rollaway. This was done online and part of the selection and reservation process not something we typed in as a comment. When we arrived at the hotel in the middle of the night after a very long difficult drive we were less than pleased to learn that all the rollaways were gone. If the rollaways are in fact first come first serve as the desk clerk indicated they should absolutely not be a part of the online reservation system. We were counting on that rollaway and really needed it. They offered us a breakfast voucher in exchange after one of the people traveling with us pressed for compensation which was nice but still did not make our sleeping arrangements pleasant. Beware that if you reserve a rollaway you are not guaranteed to get it.  ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Marriott_Marquis,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Hunger_Bowl,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCD_television,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon,renovation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t2.csv,151,Reasonable budget style hotel We checked in for 4 nights for a birthday celebration. Our first night we noticed a rather bad musty smell however we were so tired from a half day travel we put up with it for the night and escaped for a day of shopping quite early the next day. After returning the smell was quite incredible and so we asked to be moved. A couple of room changes later (we were moved to a smoking room and then a twin single bed room) we were accommodated on the 37th floor in a room that was reasonably clean but most importantly did not smell.This is definately not a 4 star hotel but rather a good 3.5 star Hotel. It is conveniently located next to a MTR Station and the staff are pleasant and accommodating. It would be more realistic though to pitch this Hotel for what it is and that is a good solid budget option to the 4 and 5 Star Hotel chains we all know such as Sheraton Conrad Marriott etc.This place is very cheap (around 1000HKD per night) by HK standards and if you can put up with EXTREMELY hard beds and a little bit of rough around the edges then it is a very good hotel for you. For a new Hotel it was a little bit knocked around and the room we ultimately ended up in was a adjoining room which was noisy when the other guests were present. Overall I probably wouldnt stay here again but I would recommend it to others if they are staying on a budget and need something reasonable.  ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Hotels,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriott_International,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_room,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheraton_Hotels_and_Resorts,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTR,Birthday,budget,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After calling down to the front desk and speaking with someone we were immediately given a beautiful new room with a picturesque view of the beach. The food was wonderful and with seven different restaurants you had a new meal every night! And the snack stand that had treats from home was a nice surprise. Both pools were gorgeous and the beach equally so and that&#039;s where we spent most of our days. Every night there was a new show which never failed to amaze us.

Then she got my guest and myself a room facing the beautiful ocean as well. Every morning you had coffee and a light breakfast waiting for you at 7 am. Then before you know it they are cleaning your room and seeing if you need anything? When it came time to go home.? I did not want to go bacjk. Hawaii is a beautiful place and some day I will return. It is nice to meet real people, so friendly and down to earth. The climate is warm keeping all pains pretty much gone.

Though we left a credit card imprint when we checked in, we were required to leave a $20 cash deposit if we wanted to make local phone calls...which you will want to do to order in food from outside the hotel, because you wouldn't want to eat in the restaurant. Just don't call the pizza places on the flyers that greet you daily underneath the room door...they are bogus. When elevators are working, you need a room key to access...or if you are the guy delivering the bogus pizza flyers...just wait until a car comes down and you're scot free!
