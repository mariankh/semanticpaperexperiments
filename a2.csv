a2.csv,39,Evolution Breakdown  I&#039;ve been a hardcore Tea Party fan for about seven years now. I even met them back in 1999. First of all I&#039;d like to say that they are extremely underrated. They are one of the best Canadian bands ever Mainly because of their unique sound. They are down to earth guys with a knack for music. All of their albums are unique for their own reasons. With Interzone Mantras I found it to be unexpected. Jeff Martin stated a few times back in 2001 that they were going to kick things into high gear and the only thing I can see in that is possibly the quick pace of the songs on this cd. I admit I was a bit dissappointed in this album. It&#039;s difficult today to keep music fresh because music evolves so much and you get caught up in the sounds of today. I however was expecting more eastern sounding instruments like on Edges Of Twighlight. They had a few but it doesn&#039;t even near in comparison. I find the songs to be all connected which is good but they sound very similar and there isn&#039;t a lot of variety on this album.

It doesn&#039;t sound new and fresh at all (apart from Kind of sunshine very much in the St.Germain style). What saves this album is the quality of the musicians that took part to it and the fact that the tracks that originally inspired Nicola Conte&#039;s ones are so good that any copy can&#039;t be that bad.
