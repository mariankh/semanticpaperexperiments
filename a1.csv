a1.csv,93,WOW  This is the greatest music ever made.  This is the shallowest music ever made.  It is so profound.  It is darker than their earlier albums,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/album,Darker,],,,,,,,,
a1.csv,94,surprised  i always forget about import cds  I of course haven;t heard of this album in the States like on radio stations or whatever   but was surprised at how much Matt Bellamy sounds just like Thom Yorke.. which made me pretty happy.  The music is different even though their voices are similar.   If you really know nothing about the band (which I didn;t prior to buying this cd) then something decent to go by is this: if you like Thom Yorke;s voice (from Radiohead) and the moody tunes that Radiohead puts out... add a little more rock to that and you have Muse.  At least on this cd.  Songs 1 5 on this cd blew my mind,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radio_broadcasting,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/import,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radiohead,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compact_disc,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/album,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rock_music,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Yorke,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Bellamy,],,
