t1.csv,1,Tips for staying at the Ocean Blue Our family of five had a nice time at Ocean Blue it was beautiful! Here are some tips that I hope will be helpful. 1. The rooms are dim I took a light bulb but could have used more than one.2. We booked two rooms they put us on the second floor the kids on the third floor. We heard several people complain about this. ( The kids had a great time being away from us)3. Be sure to tip the maid. I forgot one day because we were in a hurry and we only got one clean towel and the fridge was not restocked.4. When you check out- dont leave your keys in the room. I did and the check out clerk was not happy. It was the only time an employee was rude to me.5. I took a cheap air mattress for the pool. We enjoyed using it. Left it there when we left.6. When the locals came on Friday to sell items I bought something and they acted like they could not give me change. My husband came up and demanded my change. They quickly pulled it out of their pocket.7. After 7 days we were tired of the food. At times we would be finished eating before we got our drinks. I started taking my soda with me out of the fridge from our room.8. The safari tour was educational and fun.9. The massages were wonderful.10.We never got a plug for our tub after calling several times for one.11.We were always too tired to go to the shows they dont start until 9:30 in the evening and it gets dark around 7:00.12.The photo shop takes great pictures. Book an appointment when you get there. They are not cheap but I got 20 awesome family pictures of us on the beach. Everybody wearing white shirts looks really nice. They only take cash.13. The sun rises around 5:30 and it is beautiful to watch on the beach. We were the only ones out there and I felt safe because the security men were on duty.14. Mikes Coffee Shop was so good. We also really liked the ice cream at all of the buffets.Overall this was a nice place. I dont think I would stay there again because I like to go to new places. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,2,Great Hotel Located in Mong Kok as soon as you step outside the Langham Place you are in the middle of the real HK - and also the most densely populated area. Its an unusual location for a 5* but its a weel serviced hotel with very high standards - and I mean high! If you don tlike heights dont go here - there lifts are scenic (although a couple are enclosed) and the swimming pool on the 42nd floor treadmills face the view from the 41st.Its a good half hour walk from the harbour front and in a busy place like this thats not easy. however MRT is just outside the Langham Place mall (connected to the hotel) and is so efficient you are anywhere in a few minutes. So all the sights are within easy reach. Concierge are very obliging and despite other comments on the site there is no need to bribe them with big tips. Hotel breakfast is excellent (but shouldbe at the price) and the Ming Court chinese is very good indeed.Wonderful beds and pillows and glass wall in the bathroom mean you can watch the plasma TV from the bath and watch you other half have a --- while you lie on the bed! well there is a blind you can pull.....Dont miss out on MongKok though its a fascinating area of HK that you might not visit unless staying at this hotel. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langham_Place_%28Hong_Kong%29,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mong_Kok,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathing,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_display,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honk_Kong,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierge,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,3,Never again We had flown into Seattle June 21 to catch the following day Alaska cruise departing from downtown. Yes we stayed here that Thursday June 21 2007 This hotel is old and the AC was not working. The room was sealed up all day and it was stifling hot. The only thing we could do to cool the room down was to open the small window. I complained to the front desk several times and the best they could do was to loan me their small desk fan to put by the window. Their advice was to leave the bathroom fan going all night with the window open. Hopefully I might get some cross ventilation. I must say I never thought of that. (Who thinks of stuff like that???) Why dont they just fix the AC system? I was so hot I could not sleep so I went downstairs to get something cool to drink at their restaurant only to find their restaurant is closed due to renovations. It was a miserable night for my family and me. I guess the cruise made up for it. To be fair the staff was nice but how do you make up for such poor facilities??? If you stay here I hope you fair better.

t1.csv,4,Bleh what a disappointment.. My husband and I stayed here for a quick trip to NOLA and regretted it greatly. It was noisy and dirty and small and nasty. You see these two beautiful pictures on most sites of its beautiful courtyard well thats about the extent of its beauty I can promise you that. Add to the price of the room about $35 in fees and you have the actual price of the room. They reel people in with their cheap price then tack on a crapload of random charges at the end to push the price up. Parking? FORGET IT. They dont voucher and the closest parking is across the street in a lot for $20/day. I will never ever stay here again. Besides I dont think it will be standing much longer from the looks of it it is about to fall down. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_lot,Disappointment,charges,price,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,5,Good location I think the hotel disappointed us because of all the good reviews. Also a lesson - we should have told them it was my birthday (which it was). In contrast to other reviews there was no wine/champagne in the room and our bedtime treat was strictly a bottle of evian - not a single chocolate the whole stay! The bed was comfortable (very similar to the Malmaison chain in the UK) and the location was excellent. However I didnt find the room (admittedly a lower floor) was any better or worse bigger or smaller than any other good 4-star city centre hotel. Im glad it was a short stay as there was very little clothes storage. I also thought that there was a lack of information in our room-only on the last day did I discover the internet access in the reception area. It was a busy time (Thanksgiving) and when contact with staff was neccessary such as check-in they were polite and friendly but I didnt really feel particularly welcomed into the hotel. I would have no hesitation in staying there again but it is a good city 4 star (not 5 star) hotel and please dont be disappointed by the fact that some reviews might indicate otherwise. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evian,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine,Malmaison,birthday,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,6,Post Holiday Blues were gone upon our arrival at this lovely hotel. Our stay was from Dec 26th-29th. Great service our luggage didnt make it but was delivered to our room the next morning--airline problems. Barry made reservations with excellent suggestions  went out of his way to update us of any changes. Our room was clean well adorned with a balcony no noise from outside or inside and the price was outstanding. Much better than previous 4 star lodgings at twice the rate. Ate buffet breakfast 3 mornings--very good and convient.

t1.csv,7,Leonor is a true ambassador! This was my Mothers first trip to Hawaii. We selected the Hotel Renew based on tripadvisor.com comments. All the wonderful comments regarding Leonor are accurate. The hotel is nicely located the rooms are comfortable and clean (we stayed in one of the newly remodeled rooms) and the continental breakfast included fresh coffee juices and plenty of fresh pastries toast and fresh fruit. While everyone was warm friendly and helpful Leonor was amazing. She made us feel as though we were family. She went above and beyond in ensuring my Mother  I were comfortable and enjoying our stay. When she learned we were leaving early (5:00am) for our flight she arranged to have pastries and fresh fruit delivered to our room the evening prior to our departure which we both appreciated very much. It was a wonderful trip. I wanted to ensure my Mother who is 78 had a great trip and Leonor and hotel renew were integral to ensuring it was a success!

t1.csv,8,Great value but some poky rooms The deal they offered me -- EUR55 a night for a single en suite room including breakfast and taxes -- was excellent value given the location -- its at the northern end of La Rambla literally a few doors down from Pla?a de Catalunya with its local train and metro station and its bus stops for the airport sightseeing and several local buses. The location also places the hotel within easy walking distance of both the historic heart of the old city and the later Eixample with its celebrated Moderniste architecture. The first floor room was small and basic but clean and comfortable -- the catch was that there was no natural light with only a small window looking out onto a gloomy ventilation well. Fine if youre out all the time and only need a base to dump luggage shower and sleep but not a place to hang out during the day. Breakfast was standard self service cereals bread jam and simple pastries though with fresh fruit and yoghurt too. The multilingual staff on the 24-hour reception are friendly and helpful but as I found when I met up with a friend based in Barcelona they take a dim view of visitors in the rooms. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastry,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_%28architecture%29,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rambla%2C_Barcelona,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eixample,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogurt,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pla?a_de_Catalunya,_Barcelona,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_stop
t1.csv,9,Great Hotel for location and food but lacking in room quality and decor We just returned from a nine day stay at the Waikiki Beach Marriott Hotel. I give a tip of the hat to the front desk clerks and the housekeeping staff ..... they were really good. The open air theme of the hotel lobby floor was a truly refreshing reminder that we were in Hawaii.The food in the Kuhio Grill was superb .... we had 9 breakfasts there and 3 buffet dinners and the food and the service was superb. You were never rushed and there never seemed to be line-ups.Elevators worked terrific no problems there.Being right across the road from the beach was really delightful and all the shops were so close by.Now for the down side. We stayed in a Deluxe Oceanfront room which was really great. just that we expected more quality from a Marriott Hotel. The room was quite sparesely furnished with a small clothes cupboard with ancient louvered doors and 6 coat hangers. There were 2 small drawers in the TV cupboard to store all the rest of our belongings. Luggage was barely able to be stored in the closet. We had 2 chairs and a writing desk and a small round table. The bathroom left a lot to be desired. They have replaced the taps and faucets ........ but the bathtub has been cleaned so much that it is down below the enamel and it did not drain so you were standing in 3 inches of water while showering. I hated even standing in it to shower. The tub and toilet are in a small cramped room with a door and the basin and mirror are located just outside. Again an old sink that should have been replaced years ago.Other that that our stay in Hawaii was really great. Next time we come we are planning on checking out a Condo as you really do not spend that much time in the Hotel but when you do you want the quality you paid for in the surroundings. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janitor,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sink,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathroom,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_%28valve%29,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffet,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriott_International,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_enamel,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathtub,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waikiki,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drain_%28plumbing%29,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_design,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condo_hotel,,
t1.csv,10,Great value great location tiny room My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Triton for three nights as part of our trip down the coast of California. We chose this hotel because of its affordability and great location and we were not disappointed.Our check-in was fast and easy and the helpful staff gave us maps and directions to some fabulous locations in San Francisco. The lobby was small but cute and we enjoyed their afternoon wine and cookies. There was also a tarot card reader available but we did not use her services.Our room was tiny but we expected that for the price and location. The tv was nice and the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was small but adequate. Everything was clean and comfortable. We didnt spend much time in our room because there is so much to do in San Francisco but the time we did spend there was fine.We also loved that there was a Starbucks across the street and the gate to Chinatown at the hotels doorstep. The location of this hotel absolutely cant be beat. We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see from the piers to Chinatown to Ghiradelli Square. I would definitely recommend this hotel as long as you dont plan on spending a lot of time in the room. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown%2C_San_Francisco,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California,lobby,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television,bed,bathroom,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghirardelli_Square,,,,,,
t1.csv,11,Overall Good some negative points I like the hotel very much but a few negatives were experienced. Positive first: New amenities stand up shower conveniently placed mirrors great bed hidden washer and dryer. Great pools and gym area very convenient. They will drive you around town in their Bentleys if your going out plus the driver can get you into clubs (Ultra West) I forgot his name already though. Some negatives: Food at the bar and roomservice seemed average poor selection salty burger. There is not a functioning restaurant though they are working on it and when done will look great. I had asked to be moved to a larger suite with a better view of the CN Tower they could not accomodate me and didnt follow up on the following days to see if I would still like to move why not make such requests a priority if at all possible? The suite itself I felt was small I had stayed at the Hilton and Sheraton previously and had really really large rooms for under $80US. If you would like to try this place for $129Cn you wont have a bad experience but I think my favorite is still the Hilton large rooms great restaurant. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CN_Tower,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28establishment%29,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheraton_Hotels_and_Resorts,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger,bad,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing_machine,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothes_dryer,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilton_Hotels_&_Resorts,,,,,
t1.csv,12,As Promised! My family thoroughly enjoyed our 2 nights here the first week of January. We were worried the hotel might be crowded since there is no school the first week of the year due to the 3 Kings Day holiday. It was very quiet Wed and Thr and started filling up on Friday.The hotel was as promised. Great pool beach and very clean rooms. The fact that the rooms are all ocean view was a nice surprise! We would have liked a coffee maker in the room but housekeeping did give us one when asked (they only seem to have a few). The A/C smelled musty and toiletries in the bathroom would have been nice. All minor complaints but they would have been major had we paid a rate of $250 nt.This hotel would be a $250 per night value in San Juan but I wouldnt want to pay over $150 due to the distance from San Juan. Tip: You arent allowed to bring coolers onto the resort grounds but there are refrigerators in the rooms. If you have clear plastic cups you can pop up to the room for a cheaper refill of your favorite beverage vs. paying the poolside bar prices. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeemaker,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan%2C_Puerto_Rico,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday,January,hotel,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_(holiday),http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,13,Relax and Enjoy My husband and I stayed at this resort Feb 3 - 17th and did exactly what we set out to do - sit on the beach and soak up the sun. The room was very nice and comfortable (bldg. L 3rd floor) with a magnificent view of the ocean from our balcony. The buffet restaurant had a wide variety of food choices and serving staff paid a lot of attention to all the guests. We did not like the Steakhouse-beef very tough-otherwise would give the food a good overall rating. I would recommend heading out to the beach to reserve a Reclining lounger on your way to breakfast otherwise you may have to settle for one that does not recline. You can take lovely long walks on the beach on either side of the resort and cool off in the ocean along the way. Take an insulated mug for your beach beverages (Tim Hortons worked great for us). The common sitting area in the Lounge is a great place to relax sip drinks and meet people from all over the world. We discovered that this resort is on the Atlantic side and therefore the water is rougher and more wind than on the Caribbean side. We walked down to Secrets resort and you could not even go into the ocean there-huge waves. If you are a pool person you will fall in love with the breathtaking pool area at this resort. All and all We would not hesitate to recommend this place to our friends. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef,February,buffet,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(establishment),http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool,,,,,,,,,,

(e.g. check into the hotel 3 hours before a Chelsea soccer match and ask the concierge if he can get tickets - the response - anything is possible!). Well we saw Chelsea play. Three cheers for Albon (the concierge). We arrived without restaurant reservations and managed dinner at Margorres and lunch at Gordon Ramsey! The rooms were of sufficient size very well decorated and the bathrooms were finished top shelf (my wife loves her baths...). We are usually Ritz travelers but apart from the best Ritz (Half Moon Bay) the Covent Garden Hotel won us over with its personal attention and care.

t1.csv,19,Dont stay anywhere else in Barcelona! We stayed at the marvelous NH Duc de la Victoria in Barcelona for a four-day vacation and I cannot say enough positive things about it. My two main qualifications in chosing a hotel are location and noise level and it is often difficult to find a quiet hotel near the sights. Duc de la Victoria was an exception-- We were two blocks from Las Ramblas and walking distance to everything we wanted to see plus three metro stations but the hotel itself was virtually silent. We had no trouble sleeping! The room was small but adequate with a comfy bed and private bathroom.

Staff on the night shift were very friendly eager to please and liked to chat.Bad points: room not dissimilar to a prison cell. Tiny unrecognisable from any photos we have seen on the website. It was in the back of the hotel and was barely big enough for two people. The hallway and all the corridors smell of musty food or something equally distasteful. We were on the top floor (five flights of winding stairs) and with no lift I do not know how most people get their cases up the stairs. I am a sportsman and over 6 foot 3 so managed... barely!!!

Really helpful and understanding. Hotel location is perfect. Barcelona has a serious traffic problem so being just a touch out from the centre was perfect. No problem with noise from harbour sound insulation anywas was amazing. Quite simply cannot fault hotel in any way and would definitely return next time I am in Barcelona. Another thing.

t1.csv,24,perfect for us!!! I rely heavily on reviews within this forum..so I thought I would add mine on the Hampton Inn in the Garden District. It was perfect for us...my daughter and I were traveling to Tulane and I was looking for accomadations between downtown and the school. Service and Hotel: The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. We arrived at about 10:30 for check in and they were not ready for us...but quickly found us a room. The room was clean enought...but the really great thing was how comfortable the bed was. It had 6 comfy useable pillows and a down comforter covered with a duvet...as most of us do not spend a lot of time in the room ..this great bed and hot shower were just perfect.It is about a 2 mile distance to Tulane which was perfect for a walk....Within the area is a Rite Aid to pick up incidentals  The Superior Grill which has great tex mex and huge magaritas Columns is 2 blocks away with a great bar and really nice Sunday Brunch Cannons is just up the street...The Hampton Inn worked really well for mom and daughter wanting to see a little more than the french quarter...although we have done that too.T ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_Aid,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Inn,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_District%2C_New_Orleans,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comforter,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duvet,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane/Gravier,_New_Orleans,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,25,Sleepless......... We arrived in Seattle after a long flight from London and our first impression of the Sheraton was very good. The external facade was impressive the reception bright  spacious and airy and we received a warm welcome.Unfortunately once we got to our Club Level Room things began to go downhill. The room whilst spacious and clean looked tired and outdated the colour scheme being shades of beige. The bathroom was small and the bathtub was about a foot deep and practically useless. However the worst was yet to come. After having a meal in the Daily Grill which was fairly good we went to bed. That is when the doors started slamming............all night! The door mechanisms failed to work so when everybody entered or exited their rooms the door slammed. You could hear doors slamming 10 rooms away and it coninued into the early hours of the morning. Hence we did not have a proper nights sleep for 3 nights.When I raised the issue with the front desk they knew immediately what I was coplaining about so why has this not been resolved? This just shows contempt for the customer.This is unacceptable for any standard of hotel never mind a four star establishment. I received a fifty dollar per night credit but frankly would have preferred to sleep.In conclusion I would not recommend this hotel until they take the comfort of their guests more seriously and sort out the doors.In truth it was an average hotel with a significant problem. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle,bathroom,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_furniture,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,26,Good Experience I am a very frequent business traveller to Manhattan but this was the first time I had stayed here. I was pleasantly surprised - the toom was fairly large clean and the bathroom in excellent condition. Everything in the room worked. The bed was very comfortable and there was little or no noise (my room was on the 42nd floor). All in all a minor miracle considering where you are - one block from Times Square. And if you dont like the in-house food there are millions of options within a mile radius.Service - I liked the one touch service - you call one number to get access to all services rather than having to call room service housekeeping etc. separately. Some service gripes made me reduce my rating: my in-room dining cart and cutlery was not removed from room for an entire 24-hour period although multiple housekeeping staff would have seen it. Secondly as a business traveller I travel with two laptops but I had to pay twice for Internet access once for each computer. Central service express just told me to put my cart in the hallway and in relation to the Internet issue said that that was just the way it was. Really superior customer service would have apologized for rhe first issue and waived the extra Internet fee. ,fee,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutlery,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square,bathroom,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,27,Polite Mayfair Hotel This hotel really does seem an incredible deal in upscale Mayfair with the Ritz the Connaught and Claridges all nearby neighbors. My partner and I checked with the hotel directly through their website and got a great rate including an English breakfast for under $350--that with the exchange rate so terribly bad these days. The front desk service was incredibly efficient and polite; the maid service was prompt; the turn-down service a nice touch; and the very nice inclusive breakfast was the perfect way to start a day of sight-seeing. As a tourist visiting for four days the Chesterfield really offered a glimpse into what a sophisticated upscale hospitable city London can be. The hotel is convenient to the Green Park Underground stop and with Shepherds Market offering a variety of shops and cafes nearby and Bond Street and Oxford Street also within easy walking distance one could spend an entire day shopping very close to your hotel. And while youre staying at the Chesterfield go ahead and have dinner nearby at The Square--one of the best dinners we have had anywhere. Just a great experience in this part of town staying at the Chesterfield. We hope to be back someday. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Connaught_%28hotel%29,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claridge%27s,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ritz_London_Hotel,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayfair,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_breakfast,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_front_desk,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Park_tube_station,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesterfield,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,28,Extraordi-Neri It would be easy to run down a hotel when the whole of your visit to supposedly sunny Barcelona is blighted by incessant rain. However it would be difficult to fault the Neri. The service was extremely friendly and the room was fantastic. Its location in the heart of the Barri Gotic is convenient for getting around and also for local bars and restaurants (the Cuines Santa Caterina is well worth a visit). The interior modernity of the hotel comes as a surprise when viewed from outside - it is a clever blend of old and new. Not that its the be-all of a holiday but the wi-fi service worked extremely well. Would definitely recommend. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_Quarter%2C_Barcelona,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_design,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(establishment),http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,29,Great Breakfast During our four days stay in Hyatt the most memorable thing was their breakfast buffet (which was included for the hotel guests). The breakfast serves western traditional breakfast food with the additions of tasty Asian choices (there are a lot of Asian tourists staying in the hotel). The staff was very friendly and efficient. The room we stayed at wasnt impressive. It was rather small. There is no fridge. We rented a fridge from the hotel for about $15. The fridge was tiny. We liked the pool and hot tubs. Every night there was live music entertainment at the pool area. The spa facility was nice but pretty pricy. Overall we had a pleasant experience staying at Hyatt in Waikiki would recommend it to others. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffet,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waikiki,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment,,,,,,,,,,,

t1.csv,35,No problems great location This was my first time booking a hotel in NYC. After reading lots of reviews for lots of hotels some of which sounded scary I opted for a relatively expensive but safe bet. The Hotel Metro matched my expectations. There were no problems at all. I had a single room with a king size bed. It was small but comfortable. The amenities (bed towels toiletries TV etc.) were those of an average hotel like a Holiday Inn. The staff were professional but not particularly friendly or helpful. The location is really great half a block from the subway at Herald Square plus there are quite a few places to eat around the hotel especially Korean food. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Inn,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herald_Square,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City,bed,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,36,Think Twice We were greeted by an outrageously surly registration clerk. Our party of three rooms was split between the hotels two towers so each room visit meant 35 floors down one tower crossing the lobby and going 35 floors up the other tower. The beds were rock hard. The rooms at the same rate were dramatically different in size shape and amenities. Our room did have a spectacular view. The mini bar is not stocked by the maids its stocked later in the day by a second surprise visitor. The cost for two bowls of cereal a juice and two coffees in the hotel restaurant was $45. The concierge was helpful. The rooms felt clean albeit quite worn. Our room had pink spots all over the floor. The hotel is not especially well located it is a jaunt from Grand Central station and a bit of a long cab ride from Penn Station. The area empties out on weekends and there are few restaurants to walk to. The first 30 floors apparently belong to the building next door so prepare for long elevator rides. Everyone had his or her hand out and even ice requires hotel employee delivery.

The cylindrical aquarium that is in the lobby of the hotel is truly amazing and can be viewed from the elevator as you are travelling to your floor.The Hotel is well located on the River Spree and is close to Hackescher Markt and the adjoining S Bahn which runs all the ways out to Flughafen Schonefeld (Airport) on the S9 Line. There are also some great restaurants in the Hackescher Markt area.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is considering staying in Berlin whether for business or Leisure. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spree,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Hackescher_Markt_station,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Bahn,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radisson_Hotels,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Cathedral,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Sch%C3%B6nefeld_Airport,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Republic_%28Berlin%29,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Chamber,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Island,,,

t1.csv,40,Inconsistent We arrived at the Eliot after spending a wonderful night at the Lenox. The Eliot is closer to The Boston Conservatory so that is where I initially wanted to stay but there was no room the first night so we stayed at the Lenox. The rather small but charming lobby of the Eliot was somewhat chaotic as a large group was checking out. It was raining when we arrived in the evening and there was no doorman to greet us or bellman to help us with the bags. There were steps to enter the hotel and steps to go down to the lobby and carrying the luggage was not easy.The room was nicely decorated. Clean bathrooms cute window seats very charming. The beds were very comfortable.In room internet access was a $10 charge which I think should have been included.Turn down service was offered nightly. The neighborhood is very convenient to shopping (Newberry Street) and is very close to both Berklee and The Boston Conservatory.Upon checking out once again...no help. Lugging bags to the street and hailing a cab ourselves.After arriving home I received $10.00 fee adjustment on my bill for a luggage tag. I was told I had taken this from the room. I can assure you I have no luggage tag. I have asked for this fee to be removed and was told that it would be but as of today it still remains. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baggage,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Conservatory,lobby,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouncer_(doorman),bathroom,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newbury_Street,fee,,,,,,,,,,,

At 235 euro per room its a mediocre attempt to provide luxury with unfriendly staff not above average amenities ok rooms but with no touch of class. And if you are visiting Barcelona you most likely want to see the magnificent sights in the center this hotel is at least a 30min drive from the center.

Was moved up to 12th floor and had splendid views from our balcony. Room was small which we expected from other reviews BUT very clean  attractive. We NEVER had the first problem with anything or anyone there. I have stayed next door for about 3 times what we paid.

My husband had a stir fry entree that was quite good. I ordered a pepper soup which was good as well. If I go back I would enjoy a meal there again if I stayed at the hotel because...if you are there for anything aother reason there is NOTHING else to really do in San Pedro.

Finally its just a block away from Canal street and the famed St. Charles streetcar. My family and I loved the charm and ambiance of the hotel especially the rooftop pool.

The rooms are small as others have written but how much time do you spend in your room? They are very clean and the beds are extremely comfortable even if it might be getting close to time to rework the look of those draperies. We also love the rooftop pool for hot afternoons. The French Quarter is always loud and you will get some street noise even on the upper floors but thats pretty much every hotel in the area. The plus is that you are in spitting distance of all the great restaurants and bars as well as the street car.

Elke the concierge was great and the bell staff was wonderful. The Rue Royal location is great for shopping and it is in a quieter portion of the quarter which is nice. The rooms are smaller more like a European hotel and the layout can be confusing but it is an older hotel. It is immaculately kept. Spa Aria is fabulous Le Cafe had a good and speedy breakfast and Carousel bar is a good place to hang out. The pool was also nice.

t1.csv,61,Didnt want to leave My wife 3 yo daugther and I spent 5 blissful days at Copamarina starting on January 5th. We booked a deluxe ocean front room. Which was clean. Many of the other rooms on the property have partial ocean views so those wishing to save some money can book garden view rooms without missing out. We took the all inclusive meal plan based on the online menu and the fact that the hotel would happily provide box lunches. This way we could take our lunch and explore the puerta del sol. We had dinner each night in their restaurant Alexandra which was very good most nights and fantastic on 2 occasions! Service was always professional and the staff was only too happy to accommodate special requests. Lunch was usually a nice fresh grilled piece of fish with veggies at Las Palmas. The grounds are immaculate the beach cleaned every morning and we found the staff helpful and quite friendly. We purposely traveled the week after Christmas break and were rewarded to find the resort uncrowded. Local families and others from the States made up the majority of visitors. Most local families were curious to know how we found out about this place since its off the beaten path which adds to the specialness of Copamarina. Yes the resort is about 2 hours from San Juan but thats the reward. For those with long flights into San Juan you may want to consider spending a night or two in San Juan before heading South. The resort has 5 pools two infant and 3 regular. BTW lunch can be delivered poolside!! We spent a good deal of time in the pools so the issues of sea grass in the ocean didnt bother us. There is a staircase into the water at the end of the dock so if you want to swim beyond the seagrass you can. We played on the beach and took the hobie cat out sailing everyday. The price of which is included in the all inclusive package.One highlight was the day 5 dolphins swam with us as we sailed to guiligans Island. Overall we had a wonderful time and Copamarina is the type of resort that you can actively travel the local area or just hang out on the beach. Our only disappointment was the bedroom pillows. For the price we would have expected plush pillows. Instead the ones in our room were hard and lumpy. Would we go back? We didnt want to leave. Next time maybe well bring our own pillows! ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagrass,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_%28food%29,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunch,January,Christmas,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staircase,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology),http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow,,
t1.csv,62,Hated almost all of it I was so excited about going to an all-inclusive resort because my parents had gone to one and all I heard was how good it was so my mom found this hotel and we booked it. From the moment we got there it was bad. The front desk was rude to us didnt want to answer our questions. The rooms were dirty and smelled of mold. Luckly the second day I found a pool where a lot of people didnt go so I stayed there the rest of the time. The resturants were bad. They wanted to copy Amerian food by having an italian place and a tex-mex place. The food was gross. I think the best day I had was when it rained and I played bingo and won some Domonican coffee. Anyone thinking of going there please dont. I spent my money on a trip I wish I could take back. Choose somewhere else to go. The ocean was dirty dead fish floating around.

Large bathrooms with both shower and tub (one of our rooms had a shower only but it was a large shower with massage jets). The staff was very helpful and spoke excellent English. We ate at Alfredos three or four nights. Excellent food and nice wait staff.The draw back of the Hotel San Gallo Palace is its location. We had to take taxis almost everywhere because it is a distance from Florence center. We did walk some but after a day of sightseeing and walking all day we did not feel like hiking back to the hotel hence the taxis.If you dont mind spending money on taxis I would definitely recommend the San Gallo Palace Hotel. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have stayed at the Hyatt and other 5 star hotels only to find that you are just a room number and you are on your own. At the Ocean Tower you are treated special everyday. If you get a chance to go to Hawaii be sure to stay at the Ocean Tower. From the manager front desk to house keeping you will be made to feel like you are someone very special.

t1.csv,65,Good value for the rate confortable stay I like that this hotel is smaller but has the facilities of a larger hotel. My primary reason for choosing Loews is they accept pets. Theyre also very relaxed about the dog unlike a lot of other hotels. The rules are limited to those that seem to be reasonable rather than some hotels that hand you a 10 page contract to sign to have a dog in the room. Loews also does not charge an extra pet fee.The rooms are good - very spacious good amenities with a big reading chair and ottoman large desk and TV armoire big bathroom. The decor is a *tiny* bit dated but I like it. Everything was very clean during my entire stay for 4 nights.The restaurant patio and pool area are very nice. Small and quiet I loved eating outside by the pool in the warm evenings. All of the hotel staff were very friendly professional and accommodating. Id rate this hotel highly on their staff. My only complaint is that nowhere on my reservation or the website did it reference the valet ONLY parking which is $24 per day. Best to find a street space 2 blocks away but what a pain! They literally park your car 10 feet away. This is the one thing they would need to change to make me come back on my monthly week-long trips to LA.

t1.csv,66,Cool hotel great service Stayed at the London for two nights in Feb with my husband and we were both really impressed. The staff upgraded us to a suite for our wedding anniversary and a bottle of wine was waiting for us in the room - nice touch. Really really friendly staff too. Best bit though was the room - for NY standards well by any standards it was huge with a separate sitting area - handy if one of you is jetlagged and the other wants to watch tv! We didnt have an amazing view but it was NY enough skyscrapers etc and to be honest it didnt really matter because the room was so good. Small attention to detail was good too - earplugs slippers nice toiletries etc etc - we stayed in the Soho Grand for a couple of days too and you dont get nearly as much value for money. Location is easy youre a five minute walk from 5th Ave Rockefeller centre theatre district etc or its just a stroll up a couple of blocks to central park. If you want breakfast out of the hotel there are lots of diner places around the corner. The London - thoroughly recommended and would go back. which is good if one of you is suffering jet lag and wants to goFor NY the room was huge ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Center,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Bit,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diner,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper,breakfast,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,67,disappointed due to construction We had stayed at the Renaissance before 2 years ago and thought it was the best location and hotel at Times Square. With high expectations we assumed that nothing would have changed.Were we wrong!!! Currently there is renovating going on at the hotelwhich should be completed by October. There is a narrow entrance in entering the lobby before riding up the elevator to the main lobby area. There was blaring music that was not appropriate when we entered the building. We are Marriott Reward members and had requested a refrigerator extra pillows toiletries and a high level floor. It took 5 hours for us to receive our room!! The room did not have the items we requested by concierge email so we had to request again with the front desk. There was not an area to wait for our roomdue to the lack of seating and the other people also waiting for their room. So we went to the Westinwhich we stayed at last year and waited in their large waiting area.The room was nice when we got there but it was not very homey. It looked like a businessmans rooms. There was no flat screen tv no free bottle water ( the Westin offers) and it was noisy due to the construction. The ice machine area on each floor is supposed to have vending machines but none were visible.The fitness room used to have a basket of fruit for those that workout but this amenity was no longer available. The treadmills were old and needed updating. The buttons on one of the elevators did not light up to indicate which floor you selected.You would have to hope that after pushing the button that the elevator would take you to your floor.We still love the location and the hotel will probably look nice after the renovation but for those that have to endure the process- we should have notified at reservation of the construction-the management should have reduced the rate or reduced the points needed to stay due to construction.-where are the apples at the front desk?? all the other Renaissance hotels still make it available for its guests ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierge,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Hotels,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westin_Hotels,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriott_International,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vending_machine,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_machine,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator,lobby,,,,

t1.csv,70,The hotel sucks We booked at Liberty but we had to go to hotel Brian to check in and our room was in this hotel as well. We booked a double room but got a twin one the first thing which didnt go as planned. There was also told we had an own toilet and shower this wasnt the case. The room was dirty the breakfast was crappy and the fact we had to do our own dishes was the most ridiculous thing one can imagine in a hotel. The only good thing was the location but there are also other hotels with a good location they will never see me at this hotel again. Dont go there! ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet,breakfast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,71,About what I expected I read some reviews before I booked a room at the Parc St. Charles so I knew what I was in store for. I think the really bad reviews come from people that pay over $100 for a room there. I only paid $55 a night and it was worth the price. The elevator situation was funny because it worked sometimes and other times it didnt but they have TWO elevators so no big deal. People who complain about that are stupid....two elevators..jeez. Anyway we got into town really early around 7am so we stopped by there and sure enough they let us check in even though we werent suppose to until 4pm!!! I was very happy about that. The staff was courteous and the place was a bit run down but it didnt smell bad and the rooms were clean. It reminded me of a 4 star hotel that had not been taken care of or repaired properly. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,72,It was okay My husband and I go to New Orleans every year for our anniversary. We have never stayed in the same hotel twice and this one was okay. It is in an ideal location and the coffee/sandwich shop next door is our favorite.As for the room itself it was small but pretty comfortable. I do think they could vacuum a little more in the rooms and in the halls. The walls are pretty thin; we could hear everything that went on in the next room.The courtyard was really lovely (no bird poop at all the staff is very nice.

t1.csv,73,My personal preference -more sunlight and a better lounge. Just got back from New Orleans. Our stay at the Hotel Monteleone was just fine. The room was nice no complaints. Make sure you ask for a room with a view (may be an upgrade certain wings of the hotel building are U shaped and the room windows face in toward each other. Everything about the hotel was very pretty I just would have liked to stay in a hotel with more windows and sunlight and a nicer lounge area. The carousel bar was pretty but small and the spinning I could do without!!! Im really not complaining but to me a clean room is fine its the lobby lounge bar area that really make a hotel. We stayed with friends and wed meet at a different hotel for a drink instead of our own before heading out. The Omni on St. Louis and the Sonesta on Bourbon are places to check out if you enjoy a little relaxation and a nice cocktail before or after heading out into the fun of New Orleans!Go to Mr. Bs across the street for lunch a GREAT restaurant with a real old time business lunch feel. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Monteleone,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(establishment),http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri,Bourbon,Omni,Sonesta,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant,lunch,,,,,,,
t1.csv,74,Historic Monteleone - beautiful and perfect location The hotel is beautiful and the location cant be beat. Book a room larger than just the standard room. The rooms are nicely furnished and beds are comfy. Everything was perfect during our stay but we did not have to valet park and the line Sunday morning for those retreiving their cars was quite long. The pool are is very nice and the pool was heated above 90 degress - it was in the 50s. The location is ideal. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Monteleone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,75,Lovely Old World Charm I was in New Orleans attending a conference and did not have a choice in which hotel I stayed. This hotel turned out to be ideal. It is an older hotel with a lot of charm and character (I usually go for the more modern hotel when I travel in American cities). The location is perfect too right in the middle of the French Quarter - a couple of minutes to walk to Bourbon St but just far enough away from the noise. The street itself has several good restaurants gift shops coffee shops etc. I walked to the famous Cafe Du Monde easily from here. I would definitely stay in this hotel again. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeehouse,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Street,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Quarter,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_du_Monde,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,76,Think Twice Before Staying.... This letter is to inform you of our negative experience with the hotelvalet service. Upon receiving our vehicle from valet we were making sure our belongings were still there. We discovered that the emergency cash that was hidden in my car was missing. Only a person that put a lot of effort into digging through my car could have found this hiding place. After speaking with the transportation director he informed us that the valet is not responsible for our vehicle. We tried to self park the car upon arriving to the hotel but we were told we had no choice but to valet. This makes us suspicious that the hotel may condone the act of theft and possibly even promote the valets to thoroughly search each car to ??ee what they can find??as a ??onus?? Although the manager spoke with us he did not seem very concerned at getting to the bottom of the situation. He seemed more concerned about getting us out of the lobby as to not cause a seen in front of other guest. After speaking with several other people from Baton Rouge about our experience we were told other horror stories concerning Hotel Monteleone?? valet service that had taken place this Mardi Gras as well as for the Kenny Chesney concert just a few months ago. You can be assured that we will never return to this hotel and will be spreading the word to as many people as possible about our experience and the experiences we have learned about from our friends concerning your hotel. To add insult to injury we had to pay $30 for valet to rob us. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valet_parking,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Chesney,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valet,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge%2C_Louisiana,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mardi_Gras,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,77,Just OK Overall a good hotel and a great location but I was not totally happy with my stay because of issues with my room and the way they were handled.First the good - The location is excellent. The hotel is located in the heart of the french quarter area -- very close to Burbon St. nice restaurants bars etc. The lobby is nice with plenty of places to sit.The front desk staff I interacted with was mediocre at best. I had questions about some of the well known establishments in the area and they either had no clue what I was talking about or gave me completely wrong information about the location.Here is the bad. It pertains to the particular room I was in so I would not say this is representative of the whole hotel. However the service I received may be moreso. I went to use the sink in my bathroom and there was no cold water. The handle wouldnt turn. I called the front desk and they said theyd send someone right up. I left the room for a few hours and when I returned I noticed the sink still wasnt working. I called the front desk again and explained that nobody had been to my room yet and it had been a couple of hours. He said he would take care of that right away. I again left the room to enjoy the town some more. When I returned again a few hours later still nobody had been to my room. So I called and requested a manager. I explained the situation to the manager and how this was my 3rd attempt to address the problem and he said it was the first hed heard of it. He was going to contact the maintenance guy immediately. I explained that I was going out again and confirmed that I did not need to be in my room. When I returned later there was a voice mail on my phone. (The manager said hed leave voice mail with the results.) He said the maintenance man was unable to fix this issue. He said they were sold out so I couldnt be moved to another room. He said that as a gesture of good will he would leave 2 breakfast coupons for me at the front desk. The only other thing that was wrong with my room was that it was very warm and I didnt see a way to cool it. There was a thermostat on the wall which was set at 55 but it was way warmer than that. I did mention this at check out the next morning to the front desk staff and to a manager (not the same one Id spoken with the night before). The other issue that happened was when I went to check out and get my breakfast voucher. The front desk said they had no record of my issue or voucher. They called the manager who did come down and agree to comp my breakfast.I booked my room through Orbitz so I dont think there was anything they could do as far as refunding some of my money. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermostat,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbitz,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28establishment%29,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voicemail,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Quarter,Bathroom,sink,Breakfast,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,78,Great Location The Hotel Monteleone is perfectly located in the French Quarter just one block from Bourbon Street and close to Canal and the River area. I spent two nights at the hotel during a business convention. The hotel is historic and there is a sense of old-world style as you enter the premises. The lobby is nice without being too elaborate. The staff was mostly friendly and helpful. The rooms are spreadout through about 14 floors and as most older city hotels there are lots of hallways. I suspect the size of the room depended a bit on which hallway you were on. My room was not very big ... except for the bathroom. However the bathroom space was not used very well. There was marble throughout the bathroom. The bed was comfortable and the room clean. There was a small desk with wired internet and the entertainment center doubled as a closet. TV was not great ... but your are not in New Orleans for the TV.Did not eat in the restaurants. But the main one (Hunt Room Grill) looked nice. The bar is unique as the stools rotate like a carousel. We ate at K-Pauls Louisiana Kitchen a few blocks away which was excellent. The workout room was not very big but the machines were new and in great shape. As mentioned the location is perfect and not overrun with Bourbon Street party-goers. If you are looking for a New Orleans experience this is close enough to the craziness yet upscale and quiet on its own. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Street,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Monteleone,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Quarter,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobby_(room),,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,79,Great Place to Stay I stayed here for a week in November for business and was very pleased. The location couldnt have been more convenient.In the heart of the French Quarter on Royal St. convenient to restaurants shopping antique galleries etc. When I first checked in my room was very small and overlooking some very unattractive roofs plus tv didnt work. So the guy that came up to try to fix the tv told me if I wasnt happy with my room I should ask for another one.Thank god I did. The room they switched me to was much bigger and overlooking the river. The only issue was the bathroom which was rather small. The staff was very helpful. Especially the doormen. David and Frederick to be specific. Very knowledgeable about places to eat. No real issues except the phone charges are ridiculous. They charge 80 or 90 cents for every local call. Needless to say I used my cellphone. Also charge for internet access if u want to use their DSL or Wifi. For the most part I recommend the Monteleone and would stay there again. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soho,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Quarter,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antique,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Monteleone,,,,,,,,,,

t1.csv,81,Little Murder Little Mystery Lots of Fun My husband and I along with a pair of friends stayed at the Monteleone for their Murder Mystery weekend over Halloween. We stayed three nights two with the murder mystery event and a supplemental night. We were on the 4th Floor and had a great corner room. We could hear street noise and music but it added to the stay rather than being an annoyance. The room was clean and comfortable very attractive. Linens mattress and pillows were the perfect thing to come back to after a day of walking and enjoying the town. Turn down service nightly.The hotel was beautiful and close to everything. The rooftop pool and balcony were wonderful we never did leave enough time for a dip though. Our mystery package included breakfasts a lunch a dinner and a cocktail reception. Food was great! We didnt try any of the on site restaurants through the meals were all served in the Riverview Room.Of course we hit the Carousel Bar a couple times what a great experience. The only negatives would be someone smoking in the room next to ours the smoke came through the closed room adjoinng door. The other negative the concierge wasnt very friendly. We were able to get better tips for restaurants and things to do from the staff members participating in the murder mystery weekend. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinner,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28establishment%29,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunch,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattress,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balcony,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Monteleone,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow,,,,
t1.csv,82,Cozy rooms avoid the restaurants and the maidservice I stayed at the Monteleone for a week for business. The room was well-appointed the location couldnt be beat and the view was great. The staff were also generally fairly helpful. However there were a few negatives that really turned me off of the place. The hotel seems much more interested in getting every last dollar from you than being hospitable. For example the room mini-bars will automatically charge you if you even touch the thing too hard - it took my colleague 45 minutes at the front desk to get that sorted out. Another example - I wanted a plain yogurt from the restaurant instead of the large breakfast. They charged me $6 for a 3-oz (mini) yogurt because they were unwilling to price it a-la-carte. When I complained they said that they dont make exceptions and I would have to pay the $6 (that would have been nice to know before they gleefully brought me the yogurt). Finally another issue was the maidservice. I had to call and ask that the maidservice be discontinued because they rearranged everything in the room including my toiletries and work-papers to the point that I had difficulty finding things. I was also disappointed to see no recycling bins anywhere in the hotel for newspapers or plastic water bottles. Finally the gym could have been nice except that most of the equipment was broken. The rooftop pool also could have been nice but it obviously hadnt been cleaned in awhile. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogurt,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling_bin,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,83,Great place to stay in the French Quarter We stayed at the Monteleone Hotel for a four day weekend. The hotel was in a great location in the French Quarter.

t1.csv,84,Lovely Hotel ....awful treatment My daughters wedding was out of town and in New Orleans. We booked a block of rooms. Due to the economic conditions many people could not afford to travel and stay. Some booked cheaper hotels and we only ended up with 23 rooms. I booked my own room at the aarp rate which was less than the rate we were given as a group.Before we arrived I noticed there were also cheaper rates available at Summit Hotels website. I called the Monteleone to try to get our rate reduced and they would not change our group rate.When I checked into the hotel they denied me the aarp rate since I was part of the wedding. Since I was staying 6 nights the differential was quite costly.They knew they had me. I couldnt check out because I had many guests coming. Instead of being well treated because I had 23 rooms I was treated poorly.We had rented a car to run errands; parking was $30 a day. There was construction in the garage and getting the car took an average of 30 minutes. I was late for the wedding rehearsal because it took 45 minutes to retrieve my car.My blazer was stolen from my station wagon as well.The wedding was fabulous.

t1.csv,86,Wonderful hotel. Great location. We checked in before check-in time with no problem. Our room was a superior double double. The room was somewhat small but by no mean unmanageable. We knew the rooms were small. Since there were three of us there was just enough draw space and hangers for our clothing. Bathroom was nice but small with little counter space. With three women in the room we could have used more counter space but again we managed. The beds were very comfortable.The view was great. Our view was over the roof tops with a perfect view of the Mississippi River. We were fascinated with the traffic on the river. The hotel itself is very pretty and elegant without being stuffy. Everyone we encountered was professional and pleasant.The Carosel Bar was very nice and a great place to start a days activities or to end the day. It seems to be a very popular place. One night it was packed. The hotel location was PERFECT. One block from Bourbon Street. It was also very near the St Charles Streetcar which we got on to visit the Garden District. Easy walk to Jackson Sq and the waterfront. We ate breakfast at Le Cafe at the hotel which was good.

t1.csv,87,Reservation was not honored staff was misleading next time a different hotel We called the hotel to book a room in early September and were told no rooms were available for September 26. We were able to book a premium king on the hotel website for $179. When we arrived at the hotel we were told the the premium king was not available but we could have a standard King with a view of the French Quarter for $139. We took the reduced rate and got a room looking into an airshaft between 2 wings of the hotel. I thought the room was OK but resented the fact that the clerk told us the room had a view when he knew it did not. By the time we got to our room we were ready to start touring the French Quarter and I didnt feel like wasting our time arguing about our room and the view.

After waiting for nearly 20 minutes the front desk could not help me. They sent me to a phone to make the reservation. Again the person on the phone was useless. They sent me back to the front desk. Once they were able to get the reservation made they photocopied my license and credit card to pay for the reservation. When my parents went to check in they were told they did not have a reservation and of course my credit card information was not there so they would have to pay for it.

t1.csv,92,Basically a good Hotel. We stayed at this property between Hurricanes Gustav  Ike so we arrived the day that the Hotel had reopened. The Hotel dates back to 1886 when Mr Monteleone opened a 60 bedroom Hotel today after extensions  refurbs the Hotel still has some original features such as the Entrance Lobby  the Reception area  now has almost 300 rooms. The Hotel is in a great location 1 block from Canal St  1 from Bourbon so whilst you can walk to the seedy/bar nightlife you are far enough away not to hear it constantly. Dont forget that New Orleans has 24 hr drinking!The rooms are good spacious large TVs  an old world charm. The bathrooms are excellent but with odd features like the closet for clothes  cases being in the bathroom also. The breakfast buffet is excellent for $15. There is also a pool perched on the top floor which sits alongside meeting rooms on the 15th floor its a tad strange but works none the less. Staff are pleasant but not overly so I dont know if that was just the after effects of the Hurricanes. Of note is Miss Eva the head concierge who has been there for a life time  knows everybody  everyone and as you would expect is a font of knowledge. I would recommend a very expensive drink in the Carousel bar named as the Bar counter  seats actually revolve once every 15 mins. Great to experience but a bit gimmicky!We would recommend this property very much try to get a good deal on the Suites great if your budget will allow. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffet,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathroom,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closet,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Gustav,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierge,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,93,Ok hotel in a good location! My family of four (2 adults  2 little girls) stayed at this hotel for 3 nights on the second weekend in August 2008. Our check in was ez and we were upgraded to a Deluxe room with a cityview on the 14th floor. This room was the size of a closet w/ no space for our suitcases nor drawers to put our clothers in. The room was not quite as clean as most hotels and the view was rather dull w/ rooftop  alleys to see (boring). One of the concierges was very unfriendly and she was very unhelpful  rude. The bellman/doorman were nice  accomadating when they were around (sometimes). The pool was nice on the rooftop although it needed some cleaning and was quite small. The fitness room was decent w/ enought cardio machines for most but no free weights to be found. One day after sightseeing our room was not clean (and we arrived at 4pm) and called room service immediately. They came up in about 20 minutes or so.Thank goodness our room was free and will definitely not be staying there again. We stayed at the Royal Sonesta on Bourbon St. two weeks prior w/ my family and found it much nicer classier much more friendly w/ better service and better rooms  pool. The pros: close to everything in the French Quarter nice lobbyCons: not too friendly/ small rooms/ service so=so/ rooms a bit dirty ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Street,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierge,French Quarter,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology),,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,94,Great location My family stayed at the Monteleone last summer. The hotel was fabulous!! So far my favorite in New Orleans. The location is perfect and the room was spacious and beautifully decorated. Most of the staff were extremely friendly the only problem we had was at check-in I felt the lady at the front desk could have been a bit more courteous. All in all we loved this hotel and will stay there again. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Monteleone,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_front_desk,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,95,Great French Quarter Hotel We stayed at the Monteleone August 15-21 2008. I cant say enough good things about the hotel. Service location ambiance friendly and helpful staff. We had a group of 9 people staying and everyone would come back. If you are looking to be close to things in the french quarter but in a nice quiet sophisticated setting this place is it. Rooms are a bit small compared to newer modern hotels but full of charm. Real New Orleans character and charm. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans,French Quarter,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Monteleone,August,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,96,Excellent older hotel in the French Quater We stayed at the Hotel Monteleone for 7 nights in August 2008. My husband was attending a conference and the Monteleone was one of the official hotels. We had a beautiful double room on the 9th floor facing north - despite being one block from Bourbon Street it was very quiet. We were always greeted by friendly doormen and the concierge was a real help. The lobby is incredible. Overall the atmosphere was great. We would definitely stay at the Monteleone again - the location ambiance and price cannot be beat. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierge,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Street,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Quarter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,97,Great hotel staff not so much We were very excited to stay here after reading the reviews. Check in time was 3 p.m. We were told at 11 after calling due to early arrival that the room would be ready in a few minutes. We had lunch walked around and called back to check an hour and a half later not ready but they told us to head on in. We got there parked the car ($20 per night) they told us the room would be ready in an hour. We went out to a local bar with live music came back around 5 and our room still was not ready for us. We ended staying in a room with a view of a building vs. the river which we paid for without any reimbursement or exchange of service. The room was very nice and clean quiet the Carrousel Lounge was great and friendly staff. Do not order room service for breakfast it was $70 for two. Overall the check in service was not good but the hotel was great and I would give it one more try. Be adament about check in time. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_service,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(establishment),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,98,Fantastic Location! We spent a long weekend in New Orelans and found the city to be quite charming.Our stay at the Montleone was very nice. The location is wonderful. It is on an antique store lined street right in the heart of the french quarter and only steps away from bourbon street. The Good: LOCATION roof-top pool (though they could use more space) spa is lovely lobby is beautiful room-service efficient food good carousel bar uniqueThe Bad: doormen not always around not very accomodating when it comes to early check-in (there were many people left to their own devices in a torrential downpour! we came back soaked and were finally givein a room) bad view from our roomOverall we would return to this hotel again if the price was right. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Street,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Quarter,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool,spa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,99,Lots to Love ~ Heads Ups Too~ 1st the pluses: great location lovely hotel overall pretty pool nice staff its historic so theres that. We got a much-discounted price being there as part of a convention so price wise it was great for what we got.2nd the cons: there were people outside being raucous most nights thought that died by 1AM or so and since we were trying to really use our time it didnt bother us that much. Housekeeping staff needs to learn English...pretty sure this is true of just about every hotel in the US about now but yeah it was bad. We had 2 double beds in our room....which barely fit in our room and the bathroom while pretty was tiny. You can do better than this for a 4 star hotel in NOLA! The Carousel bar is way over-priced. Parking is over-priced too but I get that its NOLA post-Katrina so somethings will be more expensive. Would I stay there again at rack price? No. Would I stay there again period? Maybe. There are many many hotels in NOLA never mind the French Quarter so you have options galore. The people we were there w/had a much nicer room than ours...their room fit with the 4-star rating.If youre gonna stay there I would say go all the way and get the biggest room they have. Pool fitness room  meeting areas were fine; lobby is beautiful and parking staff were great...probably the best thing about the hotel was the parking staff! ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28establishment%29,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_lot,lobby,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t1.csv,100,Could stand some inprovement My husband and I chose this hotel to stay at while we were in town to celebrated Halloween. Being so close to my fav Acme oyster bar was great but this hotel has some improvemenst to make in service. When we arrived around 8pm there were no door greeters or bellhops to help with our luggage. This is not something I am willing ot overlook at a hotel. However- a while later while leaving the hotel- I did see a bellhop. Our room was small but very beautifly decorated and the bathroom was very clean. I would have liked for the tub to have worked properly but the drain stopper was missing. We improvised and just made it by. Our bed was comfortable and the view was georgous-for New Orleans. My husband loved the heated pool and the seating was very adequate for sun bathing. I would have liked to have had a coffee maker in our room but the gift shop offered many choices of pastries and coffee. The seating in the lobby was nice and open. However- even though we did not drive- I noticed the parking garage was full and guest were upset. I would reccommend this hotel again- for the location and historic charm. ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeemaker,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster_Bar,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_tanning,bathroom,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baggage,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellhop,,,,,,,,,
